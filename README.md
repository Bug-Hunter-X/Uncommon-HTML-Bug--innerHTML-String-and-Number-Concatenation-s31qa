# Uncommon HTML Bug: innerHTML String and Number Concatenation

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug related to unexpected behavior when concatenating a string with a number inside the `innerHTML` property in JavaScript within an HTML context.  The issue highlights the importance of type handling and proper string manipulation in web development.

The bug is caused by the direct concatenation of a string and a number within the `innerHTML` assignment. While this doesn't throw an error, it may lead to unexpected rendering results depending on the browser and how it interprets the numeric value within a string context. 

The solution offers a more robust approach that explicitly converts the number to a string before concatenation, ensuring predictable and consistent rendering.
